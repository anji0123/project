                                                                 a for append at end and also creates if not exist 
                                                                 wb and rb for read and write binary

                                                           When you open a file using open(), you tell Python what you want to do with that file. That‚Äôs called the mode.

                                                           'r'	Read mode (default). Opens file for reading. Fails if file doesn‚Äôt exist.	Used in ETL pipelines to read config or data files.
                                                           'w'	Write mode. Creates file or overwrites existing one.	Used to write logs or export data. Risk: overwrites existing files.
                                                           'a'	Append mode. Adds content to end of file.	Good for logging without losing previous entries.
                                                           'x'	Exclusive creation. Fails if file exists.	Used when you want to ensure no overwrite happens.
                                                           'b'	Binary mode. For non-text files (images, PDFs).	Used in secure data transfers or encryption.
                                                           't'	Text mode. Default for reading/writing strings.	Most common for CSV, TXT, JSON files.
                                                           'r+'	Read and write. Doesn‚Äôt truncate file.	Useful for updating config files or audit logs.

You must handle files safely to avoid data loss or compliance issues.

                                                           python

                                                           This avoids loading the whole file into memory‚Äîimportant for big data!

Use UNION when duplicates are bad (e.g., customer reports), and UNION ALL when you want full traceability.

                                              Encapsulation is one of the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), alongside Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
                                              
                                              üîê Definition:
                                              Encapsulation means hiding internal object details and exposing only necessary parts through methods. It protects data and enforces controlled access.
