explain each and every technical term used in this now I dont know whats is SFTP what is mapping data flows like that there any many . I said that I am a fresher and want to transition and stil you tell to some one who is pro in these
Absolutely—I hear you loud and clear. You’re a fresher, you’re serious about transitioning into Azure Data Engineering, and you want to understand every single technical term in that simulated project like a pro. So let’s break it down from the ground up. I’ll explain each concept in simple, clear language, and show you how it fits into the real-world project we built for Fifth Third Bank.

🧠 Foundational Concepts Explained
🔹 1. SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
Think of SFTP like a secure version of sending files over the internet.

Banks often receive data from vendors or branches as CSV or Excel files via SFTP.

In Azure, we use Azure Data Factory to connect to SFTP and download these files into cloud storage.

💡 In our project: We pulled daily loan data files from vendors using SFTP and stored them in Azure Data Lake.

🔹 2. Azure Data Factory (ADF)
ADF is a cloud-based tool used to move and transform data.

You build pipelines in ADF, which are like workflows.

Each pipeline has:

Linked Services: Connections to data sources (SQL Server, SFTP, etc.)

Datasets: Definitions of the data structure

Activities: Steps like copying data, transforming it, or running scripts

💡 In our project: ADF pipelines pulled data from SQL Server and SFTP, transformed it, and stored it in Azure Data Lake.

🔹 3. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)
This is a cloud storage system designed for big data.

You organize it into folders like a computer:

/raw → unprocessed data

/clean → validated and cleaned data

/curated → final data ready for reporting

💡 In our project: We stored loan data in ADLS Gen2, organized by date and zone.

🔹 4. Mapping Data Flows (in ADF)
A visual tool inside ADF to transform data without writing code.

You can:

Remove duplicates

Filter rows

Join tables

Add new columns

Change data types

💡 In our project: We used Mapping Data Flows to calculate risk scores and clean loan data.

🔹 5. Synapse Analytics
A cloud data warehouse used for querying large datasets.

You can write SQL queries to analyze data.

You create views—virtual tables that Power BI can connect to.

💡 In our project: We created views like vw_HighRiskLoans for Power BI dashboards.

🔹 6. Power BI
A reporting tool used to build dashboards and visualizations.

It connects to data sources like Synapse or Excel.

You can use:

DirectQuery: Live connection to data

Import Mode: Load data into Power BI for faster performance

💡 In our project: Power BI showed loan trends, risk scores, and compliance metrics.

🔹 7. Linked Services (ADF)
These are like connection settings in ADF.

You define how to connect to SQL Server, SFTP, ADLS, etc.

💡 In our project: We created linked services to connect to all our data sources.

🔹 8. Datasets (ADF)
These define the structure of the data you're working with.

For example, a dataset might describe a table in SQL Server or a CSV file in ADLS.

💡 In our project: We created datasets for loan tables and vendor files.

🔹 9. Triggers (ADF)
These automate pipeline execution.

Types:

Schedule Trigger: Runs at a fixed time (e.g., daily at 2 AM)

Event Trigger: Runs when a file arrives

💡 In our project: We used a schedule trigger for daily ingestion and event trigger for SFTP files.

🔹 10. Parquet Format
A file format used for big data.

It’s faster and smaller than CSV because it stores data in columns.

💡 In our project: We stored loan data in Parquet format in ADLS for performance.

🔹 11. Risk Score Calculation
A business rule to classify loans as High, Medium, or Low risk.

Based on factors like:

Loan amount

Credit score

Repayment history

💡 In our project: We calculated risk scores in Mapping Data Flows and stored them in curated data.

🔹 12. Row-Level Security (RLS)
A way to restrict data access based on user roles.

For example, a branch manager sees only their branch’s data.

💡 In our project: We applied RLS in Synapse so users saw only relevant loan data.

🔹 13. Azure Key Vault
A secure place to store passwords, secrets, and keys.

ADF and Synapse use it to connect to other services without exposing credentials.

💡 In our project: We stored database passwords in Key Vault and used managed identities.

🔹 14. Azure Monitor & Log Analytics
Tools to track pipeline health, failures, and performance.

You can set up alerts and dashboards.

💡 In our project: We monitored pipeline runs and set alerts for failures.

🔹 15. Managed Identity
A secure way for Azure services to authenticate with each other.

No need to store passwords—Azure handles it.

💡 In our project: ADF used managed identity to access ADLS and Synapse securely.

🧠 Final Thought
You now understand every technical term used in the project—from SFTP to Synapse, from Mapping Data Flows to Key Vault. You’re not just learning tools—you’re learning how they work together in a real-world banking scenario.

If you want, I can now quiz you on these terms, simulate interview questions, or help you build a mini project using these tools. You’re ready to go deeper. Let’s keep building.

give me example for each
Perfect! Let’s take each technical term from the Azure Data Engineering project and walk through a realistic example for each—like you’re actually building it yourself. I’ll keep it beginner-friendly but still practical so you can imagine how it works in a real job.

🔧 Examples for Each Technical Term
1. SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
📁 Example: You receive a file called daily_loans.csv from a vendor every morning via SFTP.

In Azure Data Factory:

You create a Linked Service to the SFTP server.

Use a Copy Activity to download daily_loans.csv into Azure Data Lake.

2. Azure Data Factory (ADF)
🔄 Example: You want to automate the process of pulling loan data from SQL Server and storing it in the cloud.

Steps:

Create a pipeline in ADF.

Add a Copy Data activity to move data from SQL Server to ADLS.

Set a trigger to run this every night at 2 AM.

3. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)
🗂️ Example: You store files in folders like:

Code
/raw/daily_loans/2025-09-02.csv
/clean/daily_loans/2025-09-02.parquet
/curated/high_risk_loans.parquet
This helps organize data by stage and date.

4. Mapping Data Flows
🔍 Example: You want to clean the loan data and calculate a risk score.

In ADF:

Use Mapping Data Flow to:

Remove rows with missing loan amounts.

Add a column RiskScore = if(LoanAmount > 500000, 'High', 'Low')

Save the output to /curated/loans.parquet

5. Synapse Analytics
📊 Example: You want to query the cleaned loan data.

In Synapse:

sql
SELECT LoanID, CustomerName, RiskScore
FROM curated_loans
WHERE RiskScore = 'High'
You save this as a view called vw_HighRiskLoans.

6. Power BI
📈 Example: You build a dashboard showing:

Total loans by branch

% of high-risk loans

Trend over time

You connect Power BI to Synapse using DirectQuery so it always shows live data.

7. Linked Services
🔗 Example: You create a Linked Service in ADF to connect to:

SQL Server (for source data)

ADLS Gen2 (for storage)

SFTP (for vendor files)

Each one stores credentials and connection info.

8. Datasets
📦 Example: You define a dataset for:

A table in SQL Server called dbo.Loans

A CSV file in ADLS called daily_loans.csv

This tells ADF what the data looks like.

9. Triggers
⏰ Example: You set up:

A Schedule Trigger to run your pipeline daily at 2 AM.

An Event Trigger to run when a new file arrives in /raw/daily_loans/

10. Parquet Format
📄 Example: You convert daily_loans.csv to daily_loans.parquet because:

Parquet is faster to read

It uses less storage

It works better with big data tools

11. Risk Score Calculation
⚠️ Example: You define:

sql
CASE 
  WHEN CreditScore < 600 THEN 'High'
  WHEN CreditScore BETWEEN 600 AND 750 THEN 'Medium'
  ELSE 'Low'
END AS RiskScore
This logic is used in Mapping Data Flow or Synapse SQL.

12. Row-Level Security (RLS)
🔐 Example: You want branch managers to see only their data.

In Synapse:

sql
CREATE SECURITY POLICY BranchFilter
ADD FILTER PREDICATE BranchID = USER_BRANCH_ID()
ON dbo.Loans
Now users only see loans from their branch.

13. Azure Key Vault
🔑 Example: You store the SQL Server password in Key Vault.

In ADF:

Instead of typing the password, you reference the secret from Key Vault.

This keeps credentials secure.

14. Azure Monitor & Log Analytics
📉 Example: You want to track pipeline failures.

You set up:

Alerts for failed pipeline runs

Dashboards showing success rate and duration

Logs that show error messages

15. Managed Identity
🛡️ Example: ADF needs to access ADLS without a password.

You enable Managed Identity for ADF. Then give it permission to read/write to ADLS. No passwords needed—Azure handles it securely.
