Technical Questions with Easy-to-Understand Answers
1. What is AWS Glue and how did you use it?
Answer: AWS Glue is like a robot that helps move and clean data. I used it to take banking data from different places like databases and files, clean it using Python code, and send it to storage (like S3 or Redshift). It helped automate the process so I didn’t have to do it manually every day.

2. What is EMR and why did you use Spark on it?
Answer: EMR is Amazon’s big computer that can handle huge amounts of data. Spark is a tool that helps process that data super fast. I used Spark on EMR to clean and organize millions of banking records every day. It’s like using a super blender to mix ingredients quickly.

3. How did you improve the performance of your Spark jobs?
Answer: I made Spark work smarter by dividing the data into smaller parts (called partitions), using memory wisely (caching), and choosing better ways to join tables. These tricks helped my jobs run faster—like finishing homework in 10 minutes instead of 15.

4. What is Amazon Redshift and how did you use it?
Answer: Redshift is a big storage box where you keep cleaned data so others can ask questions (run reports). I used it to store banking data after cleaning it, so teams could find patterns like fraud or customer behavior.

5. How did you make sure your data was correct?
Answer: I wrote checks using SQL and Python to find missing values, wrong formats, or duplicates. It’s like proofreading a school essay to fix spelling mistakes before submitting.

6. How did you handle errors in your data pipelines?
Answer: I added steps that catch errors and send alerts. If something failed, AWS Lambda would retry or log the issue. It’s like having a backup plan if your internet goes out during an online class.

7. What’s the difference between AWS Glue and Azure Data Factory?
Answer: Both are tools to move and clean data. Glue is Amazon’s version, and Data Factory is Microsoft’s. I’ve worked more with Glue, but I understand how both work—they’re like different brands of washing machines.

8. How do you monitor your jobs in AWS?
Answer: I use CloudWatch, which is like a security camera for my data jobs. It tells me if something is slow, broken, or costing too much money.

9. What is IAM and why is it important?
Answer: IAM is like giving keys to people. It controls who can open which doors (access data or services). I used IAM to make sure only the right people could run jobs or see sensitive data.

10. How much data did you process daily?
Answer: I worked with over 1 million banking transactions every day, which was around 5–10 GB of data. That’s like watching 5–10 hours of HD video daily, but in the form of numbers and records.

💬 Behavioral Questions with Simple STAR Answers
11. Tell me about a time you solved a tricky problem.
Answer: Situation: Our fraud dashboard was showing wrong numbers. Task: I had to find out why. Action: I checked the data and found that timestamps were in different time zones. I fixed it using Python. Result: The dashboard became accurate, and the team was happy.

12. How do you handle unclear instructions?
Answer: If I don’t understand something, I ask questions. Once, a team asked for a report but didn’t say what filters they wanted. I talked to them, understood their needs, and built the right report. It saved time and avoided confusion.

13. Tell me about a time you made a mistake.
Answer: I once forgot to add a filter in a SQL query, and the report showed extra data. I quickly fixed it and added a checklist so I wouldn’t miss it again. Mistakes help me learn.

14. How do you prioritize your work?
Answer: I look at what’s urgent and what helps the team most. If a dashboard is broken, I fix that first. If something is nice-to-have, I do it later. I also talk to my manager to stay aligned.

15. Why do you want to work at Amazon?
Answer: Amazon works with huge amounts of data and solves real-world problems. I love building data pipelines and learning new cloud tools. Amazon’s scale and innovation excite me, and I want to grow with a team that values ownership and learning.

🧮 SQL & Data Modeling Questions
16. What is a JOIN in SQL and when did you use it?
Answer: A JOIN is like combining two tables based on something they have in common—like matching student names with their marks. I used JOINs to connect customer info with transaction data so we could see who spent what. It helped build fraud reports and dashboards.

17. What’s the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?
Answer: INNER JOIN shows only matching rows from both tables—like showing only students who submitted homework and got marks. LEFT JOIN shows all rows from the first table, even if there’s no match—like showing all students, even if some didn’t get marks.

18. How do you write a query to find duplicates?
Answer: I use GROUP BY and HAVING COUNT(*) > 1. It’s like counting how many times each name appears and showing those that appear more than once.

19. What is a primary key and why is it important?
Answer: A primary key is a unique ID for each row—like a roll number for each student. It helps keep data organized and prevents duplicates.

20. How do you optimize SQL queries for large datasets?
Answer: I use indexes, avoid unnecessary joins, filter early, and limit the number of rows. It’s like searching a dictionary by the first letter instead of reading every word.

🐍 Python & Scripting Questions
21. How did you use Python in your data pipelines?
Answer: I used Python to clean data—removing nulls, formatting dates, and writing logic to detect fraud patterns. It’s like using a pencil to fix errors in a notebook before sharing it.

22. What libraries did you use in Python for data work?
Answer: I used pandas for dataframes, boto3 to connect with AWS, and PySpark for big data processing. Each one is like a different tool in a toolbox.

23. How do you handle errors in Python scripts?
Answer: I use try-except blocks to catch errors and log them. It’s like putting a safety net under a tightrope walker—if something goes wrong, you don’t crash.

24. What’s the difference between a list and a dictionary in Python?
Answer: A list is like a row of lockers with numbers. A dictionary is like a phonebook—you look up values by names (keys).

25. How do you read and write files in Python?
Answer: I use open() or with open() to read/write files. It’s like opening a notebook to read or write notes.

☁️ Cloud Architecture & Data Flow Questions

27. What is Amazon S3 and how did you use it?
Answer: S3 is a storage bucket. I used it to store raw data, intermediate files, and logs. It’s like a big digital cupboard.

28. What is AWS Lambda and how did you use it?
Answer: Lambda runs small pieces of code automatically. I used it to trigger jobs and handle errors. It’s like a robot that jumps into action when something happens.

29. What is Step Functions in AWS?
Answer: Step Functions help organize tasks in order—like a flowchart. I used it to run Glue jobs, wait for results, and handle failures.

30. How do you secure data in AWS?
Answer: I used IAM to control access, KMS to encrypt data, and S3 bucket policies to protect files. It’s like locking doors and giving keys only to trusted people.

33. How do you reduce AWS costs in your project?
Answer: I used spot instances in EMR, optimized job duration, and cleaned up unused resources. It’s like turning off lights when you leave a room.

34. What’s the role of Glue Catalog?
Answer: It stores metadata—like a table of contents for your data. It helps Glue and Redshift know what the data looks like.

35. How do you handle schema changes in your pipeline?
Answer: I use dynamic frames in Glue and versioned tables in Redshift. It’s like updating a form when new fields are added.
